## Tasks Completed
- **Task 1:** Fixed the issue of the CDM324 sensor occasionally giving random values.
- **Task 2:** Connected and interfaced the Pi Camera module with the Raspberry Pi.
- **Task 3:** Integrated the CDM324 sensor with the Pi Camera so it captures a photo when motion is detected and saves it with the filename format `current_time.jpeg`.
- **Task 4:** Integrated a database management system to store the timestamp and image path in the database.
